# About the App

This app is meant to test React/Redux JavaScripts frameworks skills from complete beginner to intermediate React programmer and ensure a solid understanding of React JavaScript Library based off the React Official documentary

## Components & Props

- The first session in the App was to understand how to pass on props from the parent to the child and it was abit tricky in the innitialy but later I extracted various components from one extremely nested component and I managed to pass on the props from parents to children untill the expected Comment output rendered successfully.

- The other task was to write tests and ensure they all pass successfully basing on the simple tests of wheater they are renderd on screen or not.
